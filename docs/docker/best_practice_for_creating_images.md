- Include only necessary context – use a .dockerignore file (like .gitignore in git)
- Avoid installing unnecessary packages – it will consume extra disk space.
- Use cache. Add context that changes a lot (for example, the source code of your project) at the end of Dockerfile – it will utilize Docker cache effectively.
- Be careful with volumes. You should remember what data is in volumes. Because volumes are persistent and don’t die with the containers, the next container will use data from the volume created by the previous container.
- Use environment variables (in RUN, EXPOSE, VOLUME). It will make your Dockerfile more flexible.
